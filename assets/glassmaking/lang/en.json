    "craftinginfo-text": "<strong>Glassmaking</strong><br><i>Transparent art.</i><br><br>Glassmaking is a craft used in many ways, from jewelry to the most intricate parts used in complex devices. To start this craft, you need to prepare a few tools. <br>The <a href=\"handbook://block-glassmaking:smeltery-north\">glass smeltery</a> is one of the fundamentals, it can withstand the enormous temperatures at which glass is melted. But without heating the smeltery will not work, so you can use the <a href=\"handbook://block-glassmaking:firebox-north\">firebox</a> for this. <br>The next important tool is the <a href=\"handbook://item-glassmaking:glassworkpipe\">glass blowing pipe</a>, which will be used for many operations. <br>And the last main tool is the <a href=\"handbook://block-glassmaking:annealer-north\">annealer</a>. It allows to remove the internal stresses of the glass so that it does not burst. <br>Next, you need to decide on the method of manufacturing products. Now there are 2 ways: use a mold, and blow with a pipe. <br>Remember to keep an eye on the temperature while you work. If the workpiece has completely cooled down, then it will no longer be possible to heat it up. Unfinished workpieces can be broken with a hammer. <br><br><strong>Molds</strong><br>Molds are one of the easiest ways to make glassware. To do this, you need to pick a suitable type of glass in the smeltery using a pipe, and then blow it into a mold. Molds can be single or multi-part, so be sure to assemble the mold before blowing into it. <br><br><strong>Blowing</strong><br>Complex and multi-stage manufacturing process. By blowing and processing glass with various tools, it is possible to produce objects of various complex shapes. To select a recipe, take the pipe in your hand and press the recipe select key (F by default). <br><br><strong>Post-processing</strong><br>After the product is ready, it must be annealed at a certain temperature in the annealer. This allows you to strengthen the glass so that it does not collapse from various internal stresses that have arisen during the production process.",
