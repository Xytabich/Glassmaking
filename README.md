A set of mechanics for creating glass products. [Mod page.](https://mods.vintagestory.at/glassmaking)

How to add your own recipes and other content can be found on [this page](https://xytabich.github.io/index.html?p=vintagestory%2Fglassmaking%2Findex.html).

The mod itself adds almost no content, types of glasses (except vanilla), blends, recipes and products are added by other mods.
